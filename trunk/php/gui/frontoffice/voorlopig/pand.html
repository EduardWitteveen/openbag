		Description
		This event is fired when Autodesk MapGuide loads an MWF into the Autodesk MapGuide Viewer, before the first refresh. 
		
		This topic describes this event for ActiveX Control. For Plug-In and Java Edition, see MGMapLoadedObserver.onMapLoaded.
		
		A typical use of onMapLoaded is to set certain MWF properties, such as a SQL where clause, based on external variables, for 
		example, the user name. If you want to change settings every time the map is about to be refreshed, use the onViewChanging 
		event instead. 
		
		Note that Autodesk MapGuide disables the autoRefresh flag, set by setAutoRefresh, when it executes the onMapLoaded event. 
		Therefore, calling zoomGotoDlg, zoomGotoLocation, setUrl, or refresh in onMapLoaded has no effect. Additionally, 
		setAutoRefresh has no effect when called from onMapLoaded.
		
		Applies To
		ActiveX Control only
		
		Parameters
		map - The MGMap map object that this event applies to. 
		
		Error Codes
		none 
		*/

		Parameters
		map - The map object for which the event occurred. 
		
		Error Codes
		none 
		
		Note
		If your application has notify (the second argument of addObject) set to True, writing code in the onSelectionChanged event 
		that changes the selection will result in an infinite loop. For example:
		
		var mapSel = map.getSelection(); 
		var obj = layer.getMapObject('CA'); 
		mapSel.addObject(obj, true);

		Description
		This event is fired after the view of the map has been updated or refreshed. 
		
		This topic describes this event for ActiveX Control. For Plug-In and Java Edition, see MGViewChangedObserver.onViewChanged.
		
		Applies To
		ActiveX Control only
		
		Parameters
		map - The map object for which the event occurred.
		
		Error Codes
		none
		
		Note 
		Writing code in the onViewChanged event that changes the map view, such as map.refresh(); results in an infinite loop.
		
		Example
		To handle this event from the Autodesk MapGuide ActiveX Control, define VBScript and JavaScript functions like the following:
		*/
		function onViewChanged(map)
		{
		// event handling code here...
		}
		/*
		Description
		This event is fired just before the map is refreshed. 
		
		This topic describes this event for ActiveX Control. For Plug-In and Java Edition, see MGViewChangingObserver.onViewChanging.
		
		There are many useful actions you can execute with onViewChanging, for instance, customizing layer settings such as 
		visibility, the SQL Where clause, or the data file to which a layer refers. If you just want to initialize layer settings the 
		first time that Autodesk MapGuide Viewer displays a map, as opposed to every time that the map is refreshed, use the 
		onMapLoaded event instead.
		
		Note that Autodesk MapGuide disables the autoRefresh flag, set by setAutoRefresh, when it executes the onViewChanging event. 
		Therefore, calling zoomGotoDlg, zoomGotoLocation, setUrl, or refresh in onViewChanging has no effect. Additionally, 
		setAutoRefresh has no effect when called from within onViewChanging.
		
		Applies To
		ActiveX Control only
		
		Parameters

		none

		Description
		This event is fired when a user has finished viewing distances. 
		
		This topic describes this event for ActiveX Control. For Plug-In and Java Edition, see 
		MGViewDistanceObserver.onViewedDistance.
		
		Note that the event is fired only if the distances were measured using the viewDistance method or the UI menu commands. If 
		the distances were measured using the viewDistanceEx method, onViewedDistanceEx is fired instead.
		
		Applies To
		ActiveX Control only
		
		Parameters
		map - The MGMap object for which the event occurred. 
		
		totalDistance - The total distance viewed. 
		
		distances - An MGCollection object containing all the sub-distances.
